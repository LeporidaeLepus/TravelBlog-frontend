- This is a website built in 2018 for a Web Design Contest and got first place.
- This website was mainly developed by `HTML + CSS + JavaScript` but also used fome tools such as `bootstrap`, `nav` and `jquery` to implement some elegant design such as **carousel**, **collapse** and so on.
- We used `@media` to make it **adaptive** to different kinds of devices.

(The content of the website is in Chinese.)
